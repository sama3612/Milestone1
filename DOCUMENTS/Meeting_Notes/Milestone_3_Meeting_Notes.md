Meeting Notes from Milestone 3 Meeting: 

We went over our user stories and revised project risks. We went over scenarios that our tests covered, such as simulating an attack on the captain quarters and how sonar weapon worked. We also worked on displaying code coverage in Intellij.

It was suggested that we could add more calls to getMaps() in our tests so the state of the map is more visible, and we could add a check to simulate using sonar pulse in gameplay (attacking, using sonar pulse, attacking based on sonar pulse).
